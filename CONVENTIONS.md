# Conventions:

1. Use British English.

2. Use concise names. e.g. `Creeper` instead of `CreeperEntity`

    2a. Where concise names such as `Bed` could be multiple things, use the concise name for what the name is used to reference most often (In this case "Bed" is mostly thought of as a tile/block, so it is given to that)

    2b. Where the concise name is better used / already used for another class, append the type to the end. e.g. Bed: (the tile is "Bed", the itemtype is "BedItem", and the entity is "BedEntity")

3. Use outdated, cursed Mojang names where applicable. e.g Tile instead of Block

4. ~~The mappings are cursed. Feel free to make cursed names where appropriate~~ not really anymore

5. Notwithstanding these rules, the name must still make some sense
